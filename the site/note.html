        <h2>guideline 1: Be extremely brief.</h2>
        <p>No one wants to read a drawn out letter that just goes on and on. And most likely, you're probably not that interesting. So, in the letter, simply get right to the point—you’ll always leave them wanting more.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="note">
        <h2>guideline 2: Be funny.</h2>
        <p>Just because you’re writing a suicide note doesn’t mean you can’t have a sense of humor about it. Incorporate a joke or witty remark into your note. Here is one I might go for:</p>

      <div class="note">
        <h2>guideline 3: Be cool about it.</h2>

      </div>

      <div class="note">
        <h2>guideline 6: Specify how you want your funeral.</h2>
        <p>Your funeral is like your last big party here on earth. You should be able to have it your way, just like Burger King! I personally want an 80’s themed funeral, with the song “Take Me Home Tonight” by Eddie Money” blasted as my casket is rolled out of the church. I can’t wait! You all better be there.</p>
